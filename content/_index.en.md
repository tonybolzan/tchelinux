# Tchelinux, Free Software in motion!

---

The passion for the Free Software philosophy has led a group of friends to organize small conferences to promote the free software at educational institutions in South of Brazil. In order to reach as many students as possible, the group decided that all events should be always free of charge, however the attendees are always encouraged to donate food to charities in the cities where the events take place.  

Since **October 2006** the **Tchelinux Linux User Group** has held **103 events** in **22 cities** with the help of thousands of volunteers who helped in organizing and presenting **1658 talks**, attended by **12934 people** who donated **18589 kg** of food to **55 charities**.  

There's still a lot to be done and everyone is welcome to participate in Tchelinux, helping to spread the Free Software and share the knowledge to everyone!  

We're counting on you!
